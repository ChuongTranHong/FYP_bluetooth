		How to play
		
Game controller supports two types of input:
strong and soft movement. User moves the hand 
left or right to control the game. In case many 
command in the same direction, it requires a short
stop between two consecutive movement. If they
are different in direction, the stop will not
need. 
  
The hand's movement will command the movement 
of the sword in the screen. When the sword
moves, it cut the object in its way according
to the input type.

 Each object support different type of cut
 
- Apple support both type of cut. But the strong
 cut will take more damage than the soft cut. 
 
- Egg only support the soft cut. User can only
 use wrong cut three times. If it is excess
  the limit, the egg will be broken.
  
- The bomb doesn't support any type of cut.
If user accidently cut it, the game is over.

Each object has their timer. If the timer is run 
out, it will be replaced by the new one. 
If user kill the object before its timer reaches
zero, the bonus point will add to the score.
